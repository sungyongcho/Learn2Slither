### TODO
- fix rewards
- exploitation without learning - no training, just play with current model
- save/load model
```
You must have at least 3 saved model files, trained respectively with 1, 10, and 100
training sessions. This should show how much your snake "learns" over multiple training
sessions. You must be able to start a new session using one of your saved models, in conjuction with the “non-learning” feature, to verify the performance of each model. This
will be tested during the defence.
```
- step by step
    - show the details of the training process i guess?
- args
    - sessions
    - save (save model)
    - load (load model)
    - done - visual (visualize on off)
    - dontlearn ( no training just play with current model)
    - step-by-step (step by step mode)
